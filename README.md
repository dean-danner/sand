# Sand

DISCLAIMER: This was one of my first ever programming projects all the way back in high school. The code is not as good as it could be.

I created this project utilizing Java and the Slick2D game library. Download and run "Sand.jar" if you want to play.

The game is based off one of those 2D physics simulators. I don't think all of the features were completely finished, but it's in a pretty good state.
